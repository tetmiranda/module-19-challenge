# Background
You work at a startup that’s building a new and disruptive application named KryptoJobs2Go (a fictitious application). Your customers can use KryptoJobs2Go to find fintech professionals from a list of candidates, hire them, and then pay them. As the lead developer, you’ve been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application. The purpose is to enable the customers to instantly pay their hired fintech professionals with cryptocurrency.

## What You're Creating
The completed fintech_finder.py file, which contains the code that’s associated with the web interface of your application. (The included code is compatible with the Streamlit library.) You’ll write all your code for this Challenge in this file.

_Note_ that by using import statements, you’ll integrate the crypto_wallet.py Python script into the code in this file.
A README.md file that includes screenshots to confirm that by assuming the role of a KryptoJobs2Go customer, you successfully created an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a KryptoJobs2Go candidate for their work.
